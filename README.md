# Graspan Java

Welcome to the home repository of Graspan Java.

Graspan is a **disk-based parallel graph system** that uses an edge-pair centric computation model to compute dynamic transitive closures on large program graphs. Graspan has been implemented in two languages: Java and C++. This repository provides the Java implementation of Graspan.

This Readme provides a how-to-use guide for Graspan Java. To see how to use the **C++ version** of Graspan, see [here](https://github.com/Graspan/graspan-cpp). 

See [here](https://github.com/Graspan/graspan-java/blob/master/AboutGraspan.md) to understand **how Graspan works** and how it performs in comparison to other systems (under revision).

For a detailed description of our system, please see the **preliminary version of our paper** [here](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~guoqingx/papers/wang-asplos17.pdf), which has been accepted in ASPLOS 2017. In addition, a tutorial of Graspan is scheduled to be presented in ASPLOS 2017. If you are interested, please visit our **ASPLOS 2017 tutorial** [page](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~guoqingx/asplos-tutorial/main.html). 

## Getting Started

Using Graspan Java is very simple; no compilation is necessary. 

First, ensure you have **JDK 1.6** (or a later version of JDK) installed in your machine. 

Then, copy the **executables** folder in the **src** folder of the **graspan-java** repository, into any location in your machine. The folder contains:

* *graspan.jar* - executable of the graspan-java project
* *graspan-java-run.sh* - script for running graspan-java
* *rules_pt* - sample grammar file containing rules for points-to analysis
* *rules_np* - sample grammar file containing rules for dataflow analysis

Graspan needs two input files: (1) a graph on which Graspan can perform computations and (2) a grammar file which describes how the computations (edge additions) are to be performed.

You may copy any graph and grammar file from our sample datasets [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M4WxwykUd-jX8jBA50pSNf2R-1IJ49PJ?usp=drive_link) inside the **executables** folder in your machine. 

*Note that Graspan supports graph files in edge-list format as shown below,*

```
[EDGE SOURCE] [EDGE DESTINATION] [EDGE VALUE]
```

*The grammar file consists of production rules in CNF form, where a line like the following,*   
```
A B C
```
*represents a rule such that A is the left-side of the rule and BC is the right-side of the rule.*

After getting the graph and grammar file into the **executables** folder, run the **graspan-java-run.sh** script in your command line specifying, 

1. the graph file,
2. the number of partitions user would like to generate from the graph during preprocessing, prior to computation, 
3. whether or not the graph has edge values (yes or no),
4. the grammar file,

as shown below, 
```
./graspan-java-run.sh <graph_filename> <num_of_partitions> <has_edge_values?(yes/no)> <grammar_filename> 
```

Here is an **example**,
```
./graspan-java-run.sh mygraph 5 yes rules_pt  
```

After running the above command, you can monitor the progress of the computation by viewing the generated **comp.output** file. After computation ends, **comp.output** will show the number of edges generated and the total computation time. The **.partition.** output files will contain the partitioned graph with new edges.
